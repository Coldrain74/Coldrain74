- ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! I'm a dedicated single father to three amazing kids, and my journey has taken me from founding a thriving software development company to embarking on a new chapter of learning and growth.

In my previous venture, I spearheaded a successful business focused on delivering cutting-edge Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) solutions to global businesses, particularly in customer contact centers. This role demanded expertise across various domains, from development and project management to sales, statistics, big data, networking, security, and predictive logic. Operating in a time when these concepts were considered futuristic pushed me to constantly innovate and think outside the box.

Now, at 49, I find myself back in college, surrounded by peers half my age, ready to embrace a fresh start. This phase of my career is fueled by excitement, curiosity, and a wealth of experience that I'm eager to leverage as I navigate new territories. Every day brings fresh insights and discoveries, expanding my horizons in ways I never imagined.

I'm truly passionate about this journey and am excited to connect with fellow travelers who share my enthusiasm for lifelong learning and exploration. Let's exchange experiences, insights, and ideas as we embark on this incredible adventure together! ðŸš€
